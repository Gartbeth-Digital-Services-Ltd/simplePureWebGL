# simplePureWebGL
A very simple WebGL engine written in pure javascript without external scripts intended for educational purposes.

I was 80% successful in writing a virtual reality engine using C++ for physics and openGL 2.0 for rendering.

By 80% successful, what I mean is I had a fully interpolated human model animator application and I had an almost
fully working virtual reality engine, barring the fact that there were no human model animations on it. They both
started out as "lets try this" and "lets also try this", then it came to the task of combining two completely
different programs into one complete program and during my efforts ... well I got a job which afforded me about
four hours on two nights to continue working on it and the job required that you did some fun stuff on your days
off.

Both projects got shelved, then later on that decade ... the hard disk they were stored on went fatal and I basically
lost both applications.

I come back to programming again and Im looking at javascript/php as my two main languages these days as they tend to
just work anywhere, even on a phone. So I'm weighing up the pros and cons of writing very easy to plagiarise code for
something quite innovative and I'm like, what the hell, if I can get my head round WebGl, then I have my head round
the latest OpenGL. (There were no shader languages in OpenGL 2.0.)

So I decided I would jump in and try and make sense of yet another language (and it literally is compared to OpenGL 2).

The problem is, alot of the links on the root contributor websites dont work and to make matters worse, the examples
given by those who know what they are doing are so above the head of someone opening the first page of the book that
they serve little purpose to anyone at the beginning of learning OpenGL. 

.oO(If only I could find a really simple example of WebGL doing only the most basic things a rendering engine would
need to do) I thought.

Having spent a few days trying to get my head round things, I've come up with this with the attitude "The only way I'm
going to see a simple WebGL example is if I write it myself!" (This quote has been stolen from the bottom a unix man
page written by somebody somewhere quite sometime ago.) Not that I need to read it now that I've got the wherewithall
to write it, but perhaps it will be useful to someone somewhere who might write unix man page or something for some
future deconfusion I may need.

This program will also serve me as a prototype to start off proper WebGL rendered virtual reality engines with.

I will leave this here.
